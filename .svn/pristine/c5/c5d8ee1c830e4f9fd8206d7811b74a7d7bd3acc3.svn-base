Unicon 13.x README


This is the Unicon distribution.  Please tell us
where it compiles, and when and how it doesn't.

This distribution unpacks into a directory hierarchy per the Icon source
distribution, with additions. General instructions for building Icon
sources apply; see their technical report if you need it.

Sample install:

unzip uni.zip			# maybe you've done this already
+
configure [options]		# optional step,  run configure --help for help
+
make [options]			# make -jN  where N>1 for parallel build
+
make Uniconc			# this step recommended but optional

Total success will place programs named icont, iconx, unicon, ivib and ui
in a subdirectory named unicon/bin/, which you should add to your path.

documentation of their public domain code, which we gratefully incorporate
into the Unicon language. By this point, however, our code bases have
diverged substantially.
