This is the Unicon pre-prelease distribution, which is yours for the
price of reporting where it compiles and exactly how it doesn't.

This should unpack into a directory hierarchy per the Icon source
distribution. General instructions for building Icon sources apply;
see their technical report if you need it.


Supported Platforms		Mostly Supported Platforms
----------------------------------------------------------
intel_redhat			intel_linux (no crypt)
sgi_irix			sun4_solaris


Sample install:

unzip uni.zip				# maybe you've done this already
make X-Configure name=intel_redhat	# use your OS name from config/unix
make Unicon

Should create a bin directory.  Total success will place icont, iconx,
unicon, and ivib in that directory.

Tips: you may need to unsetenv your IPATH variable if you have one, and/or
comment it out in your .cshrc file.  Your platform may need custom tweaking
if it doesn't have an <ndbm.h> and if your NDBM library has a 1024 byte
limit you will not be able to build ivib.
