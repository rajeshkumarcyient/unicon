This is Version 9.3.3 of the Icon Program Library

See ipd283.htm, ipd283.pdf, or ipd283.txt in this directory for a
description of the library.

Important note: The instructions that follow assume you are building all
portions of the library.  If you are not building the graphics portion of
the library, the portions identified with "g" can be left out; if you are not
building the MT-Icon portion of the library, the portions identified with
"m" can be left out.  Note that the MT-Icon portion requires MT-Icon.

To build the library, first translate the procedures (in procs and gprocs)
using the scripts Ucode, Ugcode, and Umcode.  Next set your IPATH environment
variable so that the procedures can be located when the programs (progs,
gprogs, and mprogs) are compiled.  If everything is left in place, something
like this will do

	setenv IPATH "../procs ../gprocs ../mprocs"

You also need to set your LPATH environment variable to the location
of include files, as in

	setenv LPATH "../incl ../gincl ../mincl"

Then use the scripts Icode, Igcode, Imcode.

Information for building the separate packages is contained in their
directories.

After all this is done, you can move the icode files from
progs and gprogs to a convenient place accessible via PATH.  The ucode
(.u1 and .u2) files from procs and gprocs can be moved to a
convenient location accessible via IPATH.
