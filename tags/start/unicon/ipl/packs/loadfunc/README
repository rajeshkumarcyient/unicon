This directory contains an evolving set of files that use the new Version 9
loadfunc() call to dynamically link C code into an Icon program.

icall.h is a set of macros for writing C functions to be used with Icon.
mklib.sh is a shell script for building a library of .o files.

The C functions are as follows:
    argdump	print arguments on standard output
    bitcount	count the bits in an integer
    cspgen	cellular automata ager for "cspace" (below)
    ddump	dump descriptor in hexadecimal
    fpoll	non-blocking check for data on an input file
    tconnect	open a file connected to a network socket

The Icon programs are as follows:
    btest	simple demo using bitcount()
    cspace	cellular automata demonstration; opens a graphics window
    ddtest	simple demo using ddump()
    dldemo	simple demo using argdump()
    newsgrp	connect to news server and print subjects from a newsgroup
    tnet	very simple telnet client

Further information is contained in the comments in the individual files.

Type "make" to build everything.  Type "make kr" to build the small
subset that doesn't require ANSI C.

A larger set of useful C functions is provided in the "cfuncs" directory
of the Icon Program Library.
