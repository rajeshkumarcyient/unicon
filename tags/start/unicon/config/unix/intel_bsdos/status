Platform:

	i386/486 running BSD/OS 2.0

Icon compiler version:

	9.0

Icon interpreter version:

	9.0

Installer:

	David J. Fiander <davidf@golem.waterloo.on.ca>

Missing features:

	dynamic loading

Known bugs:

	none, but then I haven't really worked hard at looking either.

Comments:

	This configuration uses a modified version of the file
	src/iconc/ccomp.c which allows me to set the "LinkLibs"
	parameter in define.h.  [This comment may be removed if this
	modification is folded into the base code.]

	I also found it necessary to modify config/unix/Config/runtime.make
	so that iconx would be linked with the $(LIBS) parameter specified
	in runtime.hdr.
