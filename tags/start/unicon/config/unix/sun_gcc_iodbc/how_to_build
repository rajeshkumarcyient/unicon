In order to build the solaris odbc stuff just configure with
name=sun_gcc_iodbc.  You may (probably) need to edit the *.hdr files to
specify the location of myodbc/iodbc files (default assumes they are under
/usr/local/{include/lib/myodbc}), which is how they unpack if you pick
the binary Solaris distribution from www.mysql.com and install it from
your root directory (i.e. you are superuser doing a regular install).

After that the make Unicon (or make Icon-icont) should compile.  Be sure
you have both iodbc and myodbc libraries installed and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
pointing to them.  Also, you will need a ~/.odbc.ini file similar to
