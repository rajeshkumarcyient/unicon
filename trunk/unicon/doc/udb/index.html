<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 125%; font-family: Times,serif">UDB 
is the source-level debugger for Unicon and Icon. </span>
<span style="line-height: 125%">UDB is written in Unicon and uses the execution 
monitoring facilities (AlamoDE). It combines a traditional debugging interface 
with many novel features. By design, most of UDB’s commands resemble those of 
GDB. UDB’s underlying event-driven architecture empowers UDB with advanced 
debugging techniques such as 1) more powerful watchpoints, 2) tracepoints based 
on suspicious execution behaviors, and 3) an outstanding extensibility provided 
by the IDEA architecture. Experienced users may write their own custom debugging 
agents, test them as standalone programs, and use them on the fly during UDB 
debugging sessions or incorporate them into UDB’s source code as permanent 
features. UDB is still under active development; this website is preliminary but 
reflects the current implementation in the Unicon language distribution.</span></p>
