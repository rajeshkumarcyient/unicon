<h1><A name="svn">
    Unicon Source Code SVN Repository
</h1>

Public SVN gives everyone ongoing access to the latest (or near-latest)
    files.  If you plan to contribute any changes, or want to obtain others'
    changes to the source code, SVN should make that much easier than just
    sending code via e-mail. No system is perfect, not even
    sourceforge. They have changed their configuration several times, and
    the instructions on this page may need updating, please let Clint
    Jeffery know of problems with the instructions given here.  <p>

<ul>

<li>    To grab an anonymous copy of Unicon sources from SVN,
        see the site docs at www.sourceforge.net or try the following:
<pre>
	svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/unicon/code/trunk/unicon
</pre>
<p>

<li>    To grab a (non-anonymous) copy of Unicon sources from SVN,
        try the following with your Sourceforge ID:
<pre>
	svn checkout svn+ssh://<em>userid@</em>svn.code.sf.net/p/unicon/code/trunk/unicon
</pre>
<p>

<li>    Unicon developers: code contributions are always welcome by e-mail,
	and should be based on current SVN sources.  If you've got a track
	record with us and want to get
        write access to the SVN repository to contribute there directly,
	you will need to register with
	SourceForge to create your username and password.  Then, you e-mail
    jeffery<img src="csemail.gif" align=middle> with your SourceForge user
    name and request to be
    a Unicon developer.  You get an e-mail back when you've been added
    to the list, and then need to ssh into unicon.cvs.sourceforge.net
    (one time only); it sets things up and exits immediately.  After that
    you are finally ready to do the following (translate into your shell
    syntax as needed):
    <pre>
	svn add -m "comment" --username=<em>sourceforgeuserid</em> file(s)
	svn commit -m "comment" --username=<em>sourceforgeuserid</em> file(s)
    </pre>

<li> Using a Windows operating system?  Get an svn client, probably from
	<A href="http://subversion.apache.org">subversion.apache.org</A.
	(command line, instructions as per above) or TortoiseSVN will
	likely work.

</ul>
