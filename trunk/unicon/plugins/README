Unicon Plugins - February 2017
------------------------------

This directory is home for Unicon's official shared/loadable objects and their sources. This is where some of the new experimental features are added that eventually could be moved to be part of the language, or those features that are deemed to be nonessential to be added as built-in to the language. Contributions are welcome. If you plan to contribute a new feature in the form of a shared object please follow the guidelines below as this makes it easier for us to integrate them with our build system on various platforms.  

1- Make sure every source file has a licence at the top
2- Please use consistent formatting across your source files
3- Add rules to the make file to build your shared library
