This directory contains tools for program execution monitoring and
visualization. The primary documentation is the Springer book
"Program Monitoring and Visualization" by Clint Jeffery.

These are research software products, rather than production tools.  Many
of the tools are under construction, or serve mainly to demonstrate what
information can be collected and depicted. Some of them may be adapted for
use in production tools in the future. Questions and code contributions
are welcome.
