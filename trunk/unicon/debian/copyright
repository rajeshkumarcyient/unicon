 Unicon is based on the Icon Programming Language implementation. Icon is
 in the public domain; that part of the Unicon distribution which consists
 of code from the Icon implementation is therefore public domain. For example,
 the Icon Program Library is in the public domain.
 .
 The extensions and additions to Icon that make up Unicon are covered
 by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL), found in the section COPYING,
 below. This applies to the Unicon preprocessor and extensions to the
 runtime system, and is meant for people producing programming language
 products which use code from the Unicon distribution.
 .
 The Unicon class library, and also the Unicon virtual machine and runtime
 system ("*iconx") program when it is shipped with an application program,
 are covered by the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, found in the section
 titled LIBRARY COPYING below. This relaxes the GPL in various ways when you
 are using the Unicon language to write programs. You can use these libraries
 and this virtual machine in your products, without revealing the source code
 of your product, and without having your product fall under the terms of the
 GPL.  See the LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE for details.
 .
 The internet messaging facilities in src/libtp in source distributions are
 primarily the work of Steve Lumos, who has chosen to place them under the
 BSD license, found in the section below titled LIBTP LICENSE.
